If you would like to contribute code to this project you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request. Before Comcast merges your code into
the project you must sign the Comcast Contributor License Agreement (CLA). If you
haven't previously signed a Comcast CLA, you'll automatically be asked to when you open a
pull request. Alternatively, we can e-mail you a PDF that you can sign and scan back to
us. Please send us an e-mail or create a new GitHub issue to request a PDF version of the CLA.
